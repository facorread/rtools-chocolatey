    <description>Rtools is the toolchain bundle that is used on Windows to build R base and R packages that contain compiled code. You only need Rtools if you want to compile R packages from source that contain C/C++/Fortran. By default, R for Windows installs the precompiled binary packages from CRAN, for which you do not need rtools. This Chocolatey package works with the installation defaults, which consist of the standard toolchains based on gcc (32/64 bit mingw-w64) and build utilities (make, bash, tar, sed, etc).</description>
    <summary>A collection of tools for building R packages under Windows</summary>
    <releaseNotes>RELEASE NOTE FOR THE RTOOLS CHOCOLATEY PACKAGE VERSIONS 4.0.0 AND UP

This Chocolatey package does not set the PATH environment variable anymore; the end user must follow the instructions below to select a version of RTools.

INSTALLING RTOOLS40

Rtools40 does not conflict with other versions of Rtools and can be installed alongside existing Rtools 3.5 installations.

Use rtools40-x86_64.exe on 64 bit Windows (recommended, includes i386 and x64 toolchains)

Use rtools40-i686.exe on 32 bit Windows (includes i386 toolchain only)

Rtools does not put itself on the PATH. You can add the following line to your ~/.Renviron file (where ~ is your Documents folder by default) to help R find rtools when installing packages.

PATH="${RTOOLS40_HOME}\usr\bin;${PATH}"

ABOUT RTOOLS40

This is the windows toolchain and build environment for the R project. The current branch is based on:

gcc 8.3.0 (dwarf, seh)

mingw-w64 v5

winpthreads

Rtools40 uses the msys2 build environment. One major benefit is that msys2 includes a fantastic package manager pacman that we can use to properly build, distribute, and install external c/c++ libraries for CRAN packages.
