    <description>Rtools works both for building R itself as well as compiling R packages from source. This Chocolatey package works with the installation defaults, which consist of the standard toolchains based on gcc (32/64 bit mingw-w64) and build utilities (make, bash, tar, sed, etc).</description>
    <summary>A collection of tools for building R packages under Windows</summary>
    <releaseNotes>Release notes for Rtools Collection 3.5.0.4:

Workaround for rust linking libgcc_eh instead of libgcc

Automate upload via appveyor

Release notes for Rtools Collection 3.5.0.0:

This is the Rtools.txt file, which will be installed in the main Rtools directory. See also the README.txt file there, which describes the origin of some of the tools. The tools installed in the Rtools\mingw_32, and Rtools\mingw_64 directories are from the MinGW-w64 distribution.  
 
SYS2
			  
This version upgrades the old cygwin utilities to msys2. 

REMAINING TASKS

This installer doesn't install all of the tools necessary to build R or R packages, because of license or size limitations.  The remaining tools are all available online (at no charge) as described below.

TO BUILD R PACKAGES, you may optionally want item 1 below (LaTeX).

TO BUILD R, you do need item 1, and item 2 (Inno Setup) is optional if you would like to build the installer.

As of R 3.2.0, the manuals are optional.  To build them you will need item 3 below. 

The Rtools installer will optionally edit your PATH variable as follows:

PATH=c:\Rtools\bin;others

(where you will substitute appropriate directories for the ones listed above, but please keep the path in the same order as shown. LaTeX and R itself should be installed among the "others".)

REMAINING ITEMS

1. You may install LaTeX, available from

https://miktex.org
  
LaTeX is used to build .pdf forms of documentation.
  
2. You need the Inno Setup installer, available from

http://www.innosetup.com
  
to build the R installer.

3. You will need Perl, e.g. from

http://strawberryperl.com/
  
to build the manuals.

VERSIONS
			
This installer includes separate 32- and 64-bit builds of gcc 4.9.3 and mingw-w64 v3 compiled by Jeroen Ooms and others.  For use with the latter it also includes a copy of libicu55.

The Cygwin tools and DLLs were updated on April 4, 2018. They are 32 bit versions taken from msys2.

Tcl/Tk is version 8.5.8.
